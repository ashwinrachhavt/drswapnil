We visited a senior dentist at Mahad (Raigad) town for treatment, but they advised us to take treatment from Panvel or Pune due to Oral diseases and poor condition of teeth.As suggested by our one relative we consult one of dentist in pune and as doctor suggested, we took full mouth x-ray and started the treatment however doctor unable to handle the son and doctor shouted to son continuously and son was fear and crying. so, we canceled the treatment and left the clinic. It was a very painful experience.After that I started to Search the pediatric dentist on google and after reading the description and review, we decided to consult Dr.Swapnil Rachha (Soulful Dental care).We were worried about how our son would respond to the doctor but that was surprising to us. The first visit itself happily co-opete to doctor for treatment. It is the Great Skill of Dr Swapnil to handle the kids during the treatment.During the treatment we visited the clinic several times, all times Dr. helped us and scheduled the appointments as per our convenience (as we were coming from the Mahad).
